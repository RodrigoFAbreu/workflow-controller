# Active Milestone

## Status

**In progress.** `workflow-controller-codex-worker-job-record` (H4c1, issue
[#260](https://github.com/RodrigoFAbreu/workflow-controller/issues/260)) records a Codex worker run as a job. The plan is
`docs/ai-workflow/CONTROLLER_CODEX_WORKER_JOB_RECORD_PLAN.md`. CP1 is complete: `controller/codex_worker_job.py` has the pure
`launch_options`, `stream_texts` and `usage_builder`, with `tests/test_codex_worker_job.py`. CP2 is complete: `controller/job.py` has
the launcher-keyed Codex branch (`_is_codex_launcher`, `_run_codex_worker`, the usage-gate skip and the Codex completion fields),
the `CODEX_WORKTREE_PREPARER` (default `None`, so the branch refuses before the launch) and `CODEX_HOME_RESOLVER` seams, and
`runtime.fill_log_file` writes the two stream files; `tests/test_job_codex_worker.py` drives it through `execute_step` with the
fake Codex. Nothing real reaches the branch. CP3 adds the opt-in live proof, the guides and the roadmap. The previous item is
recorded below.

**Complete.** `workflow-controller-codex-worker-launch` (H4b2, issue
[#255](https://github.com/RodrigoFAbreu/workflow-controller/issues/255)) is implemented (CP1 to CP3 and the functional review) and accepted by policy. The plan is
`docs/ai-workflow/CONTROLLER_CODEX_WORKER_LAUNCH_PLAN.md`. `controller/codex_worker.py` has `launch_codex_worker` (headless
one-shot `codex exec` in the job's worktree under the H4b1 sandbox, on a build verified by `verify-codex`), `classify`, the
settling and `CodexLauncher`, with the worker's composed-configuration check and the nested-repository refusal in
`controller/codex_worker_sandbox.py`. It is registered for a fixture role only: `CODEX.roles` and `worker_launch.LAUNCHERS` are
unchanged. `tests/test_codex_worker_live.py` is opt-in and its measured run is recorded in
`tests/harness_contract/codex/worker_launch.txt`. The guides and the roadmap state the launcher in place; the change is a
`chore:` with no release. A cross-shard tag collision in `tests/test_codex_tester.py` is pre-existing and reported for a
follow-up issue.

Next action: `/milestone-plan` for H4c ([#260](https://github.com/RodrigoFAbreu/workflow-controller/issues/260), the Codex worker's job record, usage and reaping), the next incomplete item on `docs/ROADMAP.md`. The previous item is recorded below.

**Complete.** `workflow-controller-codex-worker-sandbox` (H4b1, issue
[#252](https://github.com/RodrigoFAbreu/workflow-controller/issues/252)) is implemented (CP1 to CP3 and the functional review) and accepted by policy. The plan is
`docs/ai-workflow/CONTROLLER_CODEX_WORKER_SANDBOX_PLAN.md`. CP1 is complete: `controller/codex_worker_sandbox.py` has
`WorkerLayout`, `check_worktree`, the `worker` profile (worktree and scratch writable, `.git/hooks` and `.git/config`
read, network off), the pinned `codex exec` line, `check_home`, `check_launch` and `build`, with
`tests/test_codex_worker_sandbox.py`. CP2 is complete: the module also has the worker probes (`probe_command`, `probe_prompt`,
`judge`, `sandbox_probe_argv`) and the git guard (`guard_digest`, `check_guard`), which detects any change under `.git`
other than what a commit or a plain `git gc` writes, and refuses a symlink, a special file or an alternates file there.
CP3 is complete: `tests/test_codex_worker_sandbox_live.py` (opt-in, skipped by default and on CI) ran the identical probe
command under `codex sandbox -P worker` and one `codex exec` turn on `codex-cli 0.163.0`, and both passed
(`tests/harness_contract/codex/worker_sandbox.txt`). The live run found a defect in CP1's profile: Codex keeps `.git`
read-only inside a writable root unless it is listed, so `git commit` failed on `index.lock`; the profile now lists the
worktree's `.git` as `write`, and the nested read-only `.git/hooks` and `.git/config` entries then held (a write to either
was refused). The harness and worker guides and the roadmap (H4b split into H4b1, done, and H4b2) state it in place.
Nothing calls the module; the change is a `chore:` with no release. The self-review's full suite found two hygiene
guards the new tests broke: `tests/test_codex_worker_sandbox.py` now creates its repositories through
`fixtures.git_init`/`git_clone`, and `tests/process_fixtures.py`'s `LEFTOVER_INVENTORY` has a row for each new test file.

Next action: `/milestone-plan` for H4b2 ([#255](https://github.com/RodrigoFAbreu/workflow-controller/issues/255), the Codex
worker launcher, which also closes the composed-configuration and nested-repository limits). The previous item is recorded below.

**Complete.** `workflow-controller-orchestrator-stops` (NF3, issue
[#244](https://github.com/RodrigoFAbreu/workflow-controller/issues/244)) is implemented (CP1 and CP2 and the functional review) and accepted by policy. The plan is `docs/ai-workflow/CONTROLLER_ORCHESTRATOR_STOPS_PLAN.md`. A gate record
carries `protocol_gate` with `row`, `disposition`, `action_id`, `reason_code` and the Controller's own `code`, and
`derive_job_event` announces a stop the orchestrator handles as `orchestrator_wait` (a wait) or `lane_blocked` (a repair)
instead of `user_gate`; every other, unknown or legacy stop stays `user_gate`. The automation and commands guides, ADR 0012
and the roadmap state the rule in place. The self-review changed one test: the scenario
`scenario-codex-review-implementation-stage-limit` stops at a `gate_evidence_unmet` technical approval gate, so it now
expects `lane_blocked` there, not `user_gate` (D2). The change is a `fix:`, a patch release.

Next action: `/milestone-plan` for H4b ([#252](https://github.com/RodrigoFAbreu/workflow-controller/issues/252), the Codex worker launch), the next incomplete item on `docs/ROADMAP.md`. The previous item is recorded below.

**Complete.** `workflow-controller-user-only-scan` (TK1, issue
[#247](https://github.com/RodrigoFAbreu/workflow-controller/issues/247)) is implemented (CP1 and CP2). The plan is
`docs/ai-workflow/CONTROLLER_USER_ONLY_SCAN_PLAN.md`. `worker._task_tokens` splits a task on `=` and on every character a
name or path cannot contain, so the Claude launch scan and the Codex renderer find a user-only command name wrapped in `!`,
`?`, brackets, quotes or markup, or behind `=`; a name inside a longer word or path is still not refused. The workers guide
and the roadmap state the rule in place. The change is a `fix:`, a patch release. The previous item is recorded below.

**Complete.** `workflow-controller-codex-command-render` (H4a, issue
[#242](https://github.com/RodrigoFAbreu/workflow-controller/issues/242)) is implemented (CP1 and CP2 and the functional review) and accepted by policy. The plan is
`docs/ai-workflow/CONTROLLER_CODEX_COMMAND_RENDER_PLAN.md`. `controller/command_files.py` adds
`render_command`, a pure function that renders a shared command file and an argument string into a Codex prompt and
refuses the user-only commands (`tests/test_command_files.py`). Nothing calls it. The harness and worker guides and the roadmap state it in place; the change is a `chore:` with no release. The previous item is recorded below.

**Complete.** `workflow-controller-codex-tester-fallback` (C10g-3c2, issue
[#236](https://github.com/RodrigoFAbreu/workflow-controller/issues/236)) is implemented (CP1 to CP3 and the functional review) and accepted by policy. The plan is
`docs/ai-workflow/CONTROLLER_CODEX_TESTER_FALLBACK_PLAN.md`. A `functional-tester` chain longer than one is walked before the
spawn (`codex_tester.selection_error`, `job._tester_probe`), a Codex tester has a `usage_record` from its rollouts and a
`telemetry` block, and `tests/test_codex_tester_live.py` has a second opt-in test through `_functional_launch`. The first
real round (31 October 2026: `gpt-6.1-sol`, effort `high`, `job.execute_step` on a scratch item at row 38e) ran to
`findings` with a correct report, credentials `unchanged`, the sandbox removed, 12,594 input, 46,080 cache-read, 1,061
output and 93 reasoning tokens in `usage_record` and a `telemetry` block with harness `codex`; no defect was found. The
change is a `feat:`, a minor release. The previous item is recorded below.

**Complete.** `workflow-controller-codex-tester-routing` (C10g-3c1, issue
[#223](https://github.com/RodrigoFAbreu/workflow-controller/issues/223)) is implemented (CP1 to CP3 and the functional review) and
accepted by policy. The plan is `docs/ai-workflow/CONTROLLER_CODEX_TESTER_ROUTING_PLAN.md`. Routing accepts `codex` for the
`functional-tester` role (the model `gpt-6.1-sol` and an effort `high` or `xhigh` named, no Codex defaults), and
`job._run_functional` runs the launch, usage provider, credential and record fields of the route's harness;
`cli._functional_options` carries both harness homes and binaries. The guides, the table and the roadmap state it in place. The
change is a `feat:`, a minor release. The previous item is recorded below.

**Complete.** `workflow-controller-codex-tester-surroundings` (C10g-3b2b, issue
[#231](https://github.com/RodrigoFAbreu/workflow-controller/issues/231)) is implemented (CP1 to CP3 and the functional
review) and accepted by policy. The plan is `docs/ai-workflow/CONTROLLER_CODEX_TESTER_SURROUNDINGS_PLAN.md`. Codex declares the
tester role with `verify-codex`, routing refuses the pair until C10g-3c, and `codex_tester.launch_codex_functional` adds the
build gate, the before/after snapshots, the binding check and the refusal mapping, with `tests/test_codex_tester_launch.py`;
the guides, the generated table and the roadmap state the new facts in place. Nothing calls the launch until C10g-3c; the
change is a `chore:` with no release. The previous item is recorded below.

**Complete.** `workflow-controller-codex-tester-run` (C10g-3b2a, issue
[#228](https://github.com/RodrigoFAbreu/workflow-controller/issues/228)) is implemented (CP1 to CP3, the self-review fixes and the functional review) and accepted by policy. The plan is
`docs/ai-workflow/CONTROLLER_CODEX_TESTER_RUN_PLAN.md`. `controller/codex_tester.py` adds `run_tester`: the launch
controls, `codex exec` under a deadline, the outcome (`ran`, `timeout`, `limit`, `failed`), the final message, the
readings, the credential copy-back and the removal of the credential copy on every path, in the Claude launch's result
shape. `Built` records the credential digest, model and effort. CP3 adds the opt-in live test
(`tests/test_codex_tester_live.py`, one model turn; run once: `ran` with a final message), rewords the last
`codex_bridge.SANDBOX_LIMITS` entry, adds the read-roots assertion to the prompt test and updates the guide and
roadmap. Nothing calls `run_tester`; the change is a `chore:` with no release.

## Functional review checklist

Item `workflow-controller-codex-worker-launch` (H4b2, issue [#255](https://github.com/RodrigoFAbreu/workflow-controller/issues/255)),
implementation revision 3. Every flow is offline and unit-level (no real Claude, Codex, network, `gh` or `ssh`; the launch
tests use a fake Codex) except flow 9, the opt-in live proof, which is operator-run. Run from the product clone with `TMPDIR`
set to a writable scratch directory, one module at a time, `python3 -B` and no `PYTHONPATH=.`. The tester's sandbox has a
read-only `/tmp` and a restricted `PATH`: a flow that creates folders or runs git (flows 1 to 3) is `environment`-limited
there and operator-run. No flow writes inside the product clone.

| # | Flow | Command | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Launcher: order of the launch, outcomes, settling (R2, R3) | `python3 -B -m unittest tests.test_codex_worker` | Passes (fake Codex, no network): an unverified build is refused naming `verify-codex` before any write or process; the four outcomes (`SUCCESS`, `TIMEOUT`, `LIMIT`, `FAILED`) classify; a changed guard digest is a breach; the credential copy is removed on every path, including a launch called from an `except` block. |
| 2 | Composed-configuration check and nested-repository refusal (R1) | `python3 -B -m unittest tests.test_codex_worker_sandbox` | Passes: `compose_argv`, `check_compose_argv`, `effective_policy`, `check_effective`, `check_composed` and `nested_git_entries`/`check_nested` accept the worker profile and refuse a layer, setting or nested `.git` entry that widens it. |
| 3 | Neighbouring modules unchanged (R1, R3) | `python3 -B -m unittest tests.test_codex_sandbox tests.test_codex_tester tests.test_worker_launch tests.test_harness tests.test_command_files` | Passes: the tester modules, the Claude launch and the harness declarations are unchanged; `CODEX.roles` and `worker_launch.LAUNCHERS` have no real Codex worker entry; `codex_worker` is the one module importing `command_files`. |
| 4 | Registration and write containment (R3) | `python3 -B -m unittest tests.test_package_structure tests.test_write_containment` | Passes: `codex_worker` is in the package list and dependency order; the scan accepts both new modules. |
| 5 | Test-hygiene inventory | `python3 -B -m unittest tests.test_fake_claude_contract` | Passes: `LEFTOVER_INVENTORY` has a row for each new test file. |
| 6 | Live test skipped by default (R4) | `python3 -B -m unittest tests.test_codex_worker_live -v` | Every test is reported `skipped` (opt-in variable unset); no process is started. |
| 7 | Documents (R4) | `python3 -B tools/check_docs.py` | Exits 0; `docs/guide/harnesses.md`, `workers.md` and `development.md` and the roadmap state the launcher, its limits and H4c as next. |
| 8 | Generated harness table | `python3 -B tools/harness_table.py --check` | Exits 0 (no drift; the launcher adds no declaration). |
| 9 | Live proof (R4), operator-run | `CONTROLLER_LIVE_CODEX_TESTS=1 python3 -B -m unittest tests.test_codex_worker_live -v` | Needs real `codex` (0.163.0), `bwrap`, a recorded `verify-codex` build and a credential file. Both tests pass (the rendered command, then one short real turn): outcome `SUCCESS` with a non-empty final message, no breach, a new commit in the clone, the guard digest accepted, no nested `.git`, the credential copy removed. Matches `tests/harness_contract/codex/worker_launch.txt` (measured 2026-11-01). |

**Known limitations / out of scope.** Nothing reaches the launcher: it is registered for a fixture role only, with no real
`LAUNCHERS` key, Codex worker role, setting, option, exit code or gate. The job's worktree is created by the caller (H4c
prepares it); job records, usage derivation, ownership tags and reaping on a timeout are H4c; usage windows H4d; review roles
H4e; `milestone-implement` on Codex H4f. A worktree that legitimately vendors a nested repository is refused. The change is a
`chore:` with no release. The full suite is not a flow (`test_functional_sandbox` has a known CI flake, #206;
`tests/test_codex_tester.py` has a pre-existing shared-tag collision reported for a follow-up).

## Next action

Manual functional review of H4b2 (the checklist above), then `/accept-milestone`; after it, `/milestone-plan` for H4c (the job record, usage and reaping).
