# Active Milestone

## Status

**In progress.** `workflow-controller-codex-worker-sandbox` (H4b1, issue
[#252](https://github.com/RodrigoFAbreu/workflow-controller/issues/252)) is implemented (CP1 to CP3), awaiting the implementation review. The plan is
`docs/ai-workflow/CONTROLLER_CODEX_WORKER_SANDBOX_PLAN.md`. CP1 is complete: `controller/codex_worker_sandbox.py` has
`WorkerLayout`, `check_worktree`, the `worker` profile (worktree and scratch writable, `.git/hooks` and `.git/config`
read, network off), the pinned `codex exec` line, `check_home`, `check_launch` and `build`, with
`tests/test_codex_worker_sandbox.py`. CP2 is complete: the module also has the worker probes (`probe_command`, `probe_prompt`,
`judge`, `sandbox_probe_argv`) and the git guard (`guard_digest`, `check_guard`), which detects any change under `.git`
other than what a commit or a plain `git gc` writes, and refuses a symlink, a special file or an alternates file there.
CP3 is complete: `tests/test_codex_worker_sandbox_live.py` (opt-in, skipped by default and on CI) ran the identical probe
command under `codex sandbox -P worker` and one `codex exec` turn on `codex-cli 0.163.0`, and both passed
(`tests/harness_contract/codex/worker_sandbox.txt`). The live run found a defect in CP1's profile: Codex keeps `.git`
read-only inside a writable root unless it is listed, so `git commit` failed on `index.lock`; the profile now lists the
worktree's `.git` as `write`, and the nested read-only `.git/hooks` and `.git/config` entries then held (a write to either
was refused). The harness and worker guides and the roadmap (H4b split into H4b1, done, and H4b2) state it in place.
Nothing calls the module; the change is a `chore:` with no release. The self-review's full suite found two hygiene
guards the new tests broke: `tests/test_codex_worker_sandbox.py` now creates its repositories through
`fixtures.git_init`/`git_clone`, and `tests/process_fixtures.py`'s `LEFTOVER_INVENTORY` has a row for each new test file.

Next action: `/milestone-plan` for H4b2 ([#255](https://github.com/RodrigoFAbreu/workflow-controller/issues/255), the Codex
worker launcher, which also closes the composed-configuration and nested-repository limits). The previous item is recorded below.

**Complete.** `workflow-controller-orchestrator-stops` (NF3, issue
[#244](https://github.com/RodrigoFAbreu/workflow-controller/issues/244)) is implemented (CP1 and CP2 and the functional review) and accepted by policy. The plan is `docs/ai-workflow/CONTROLLER_ORCHESTRATOR_STOPS_PLAN.md`. A gate record
carries `protocol_gate` with `row`, `disposition`, `action_id`, `reason_code` and the Controller's own `code`, and
`derive_job_event` announces a stop the orchestrator handles as `orchestrator_wait` (a wait) or `lane_blocked` (a repair)
instead of `user_gate`; every other, unknown or legacy stop stays `user_gate`. The automation and commands guides, ADR 0012
and the roadmap state the rule in place. The self-review changed one test: the scenario
`scenario-codex-review-implementation-stage-limit` stops at a `gate_evidence_unmet` technical approval gate, so it now
expects `lane_blocked` there, not `user_gate` (D2). The change is a `fix:`, a patch release.

Next action: `/milestone-plan` for H4b ([#252](https://github.com/RodrigoFAbreu/workflow-controller/issues/252), the Codex worker launch), the next incomplete item on `docs/ROADMAP.md`. The previous item is recorded below.

**Complete.** `workflow-controller-user-only-scan` (TK1, issue
[#247](https://github.com/RodrigoFAbreu/workflow-controller/issues/247)) is implemented (CP1 and CP2). The plan is
`docs/ai-workflow/CONTROLLER_USER_ONLY_SCAN_PLAN.md`. `worker._task_tokens` splits a task on `=` and on every character a
name or path cannot contain, so the Claude launch scan and the Codex renderer find a user-only command name wrapped in `!`,
`?`, brackets, quotes or markup, or behind `=`; a name inside a longer word or path is still not refused. The workers guide
and the roadmap state the rule in place. The change is a `fix:`, a patch release. The previous item is recorded below.

**Complete.** `workflow-controller-codex-command-render` (H4a, issue
[#242](https://github.com/RodrigoFAbreu/workflow-controller/issues/242)) is implemented (CP1 and CP2 and the functional review) and accepted by policy. The plan is
`docs/ai-workflow/CONTROLLER_CODEX_COMMAND_RENDER_PLAN.md`. `controller/command_files.py` adds
`render_command`, a pure function that renders a shared command file and an argument string into a Codex prompt and
refuses the user-only commands (`tests/test_command_files.py`). Nothing calls it. The harness and worker guides and the roadmap state it in place; the change is a `chore:` with no release. The previous item is recorded below.

**Complete.** `workflow-controller-codex-tester-fallback` (C10g-3c2, issue
[#236](https://github.com/RodrigoFAbreu/workflow-controller/issues/236)) is implemented (CP1 to CP3 and the functional review) and accepted by policy. The plan is
`docs/ai-workflow/CONTROLLER_CODEX_TESTER_FALLBACK_PLAN.md`. A `functional-tester` chain longer than one is walked before the
spawn (`codex_tester.selection_error`, `job._tester_probe`), a Codex tester has a `usage_record` from its rollouts and a
`telemetry` block, and `tests/test_codex_tester_live.py` has a second opt-in test through `_functional_launch`. The first
real round (31 October 2026: `gpt-6.1-sol`, effort `high`, `job.execute_step` on a scratch item at row 38e) ran to
`findings` with a correct report, credentials `unchanged`, the sandbox removed, 12,594 input, 46,080 cache-read, 1,061
output and 93 reasoning tokens in `usage_record` and a `telemetry` block with harness `codex`; no defect was found. The
change is a `feat:`, a minor release. The previous item is recorded below.

**Complete.** `workflow-controller-codex-tester-routing` (C10g-3c1, issue
[#223](https://github.com/RodrigoFAbreu/workflow-controller/issues/223)) is implemented (CP1 to CP3 and the functional review) and
accepted by policy. The plan is `docs/ai-workflow/CONTROLLER_CODEX_TESTER_ROUTING_PLAN.md`. Routing accepts `codex` for the
`functional-tester` role (the model `gpt-6.1-sol` and an effort `high` or `xhigh` named, no Codex defaults), and
`job._run_functional` runs the launch, usage provider, credential and record fields of the route's harness;
`cli._functional_options` carries both harness homes and binaries. The guides, the table and the roadmap state it in place. The
change is a `feat:`, a minor release. The previous item is recorded below.

**Complete.** `workflow-controller-codex-tester-surroundings` (C10g-3b2b, issue
[#231](https://github.com/RodrigoFAbreu/workflow-controller/issues/231)) is implemented (CP1 to CP3 and the functional
review) and accepted by policy. The plan is `docs/ai-workflow/CONTROLLER_CODEX_TESTER_SURROUNDINGS_PLAN.md`. Codex declares the
tester role with `verify-codex`, routing refuses the pair until C10g-3c, and `codex_tester.launch_codex_functional` adds the
build gate, the before/after snapshots, the binding check and the refusal mapping, with `tests/test_codex_tester_launch.py`;
the guides, the generated table and the roadmap state the new facts in place. Nothing calls the launch until C10g-3c; the
change is a `chore:` with no release. The previous item is recorded below.

**Complete.** `workflow-controller-codex-tester-run` (C10g-3b2a, issue
[#228](https://github.com/RodrigoFAbreu/workflow-controller/issues/228)) is implemented (CP1 to CP3, the self-review fixes and the functional review) and accepted by policy. The plan is
`docs/ai-workflow/CONTROLLER_CODEX_TESTER_RUN_PLAN.md`. `controller/codex_tester.py` adds `run_tester`: the launch
controls, `codex exec` under a deadline, the outcome (`ran`, `timeout`, `limit`, `failed`), the final message, the
readings, the credential copy-back and the removal of the credential copy on every path, in the Claude launch's result
shape. `Built` records the credential digest, model and effort. CP3 adds the opt-in live test
(`tests/test_codex_tester_live.py`, one model turn; run once: `ran` with a final message), rewords the last
`codex_bridge.SANDBOX_LIMITS` entry, adds the read-roots assertion to the prompt test and updates the guide and
roadmap. Nothing calls `run_tester`; the change is a `chore:` with no release.

## Functional review checklist

Item `workflow-controller-orchestrator-stops` (NF3, issue [#244](https://github.com/RodrigoFAbreu/workflow-controller/issues/244)),
implementation revision 2. Every flow is offline and unit-level (no real Claude, Codex, network or `gh`). Run from the
product clone with `TMPDIR` set to a writable scratch directory, one module at a time, `python3 -B` and no
`PYTHONPATH=.`. The tester's sandbox has a read-only `/tmp`: a flow whose module creates folders there is
`environment`-limited and operator-run.

| # | Flow | Command | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Event per stop (R1, R2) | `python3 -B -m unittest tests.test_notifications_wiring` | Passes: a record per stop of the issue's table gives `orchestrator_wait` or `lane_blocked`; each real decision, unknown or legacy stop stays `user_gate`; a stop already announced is not announced again. |
| 2 | Event settings (R3) | `python3 -B -m unittest tests.test_notify tests.test_settings` | Passes: `orchestrator_wait` is `INFO`/`LOW`, on by default, can be disabled, and validates in a settings file. |
| 3 | Protocol decision and job (R2) | `python3 -B -m unittest tests.test_protocol_decision tests.test_protocol_job tests.test_protocol_lifecycle` | Passes: the gate record carries `protocol_gate` (`row`, `disposition`, `action_id`, `reason_code`, `code`); the rule reads those facts, never message text. |
| 4 | Existing waits unchanged | `python3 -B -m unittest tests.test_pr_report tests.test_functional_lifecycle` | Passes: the `review_wait`, `checks_wait` and `lane_blocked` cases are unchanged; the scenario `scenario-codex-review-implementation-stage-limit` expects `lane_blocked` at its `gate_evidence_unmet` gate. |
| 5 | Documents (R3) | `python3 -B tools/check_docs.py` | Exits 0; the automation and commands guides, ADR 0012 and the roadmap state the rule in place. |

**Known limitations / out of scope.** No new setting, option, exit code, gate or gate identity; message text is never
parsed; H4b is a later item. The change is a `fix:`, a patch release.

## Next action

`/milestone-plan` for NF3 ([#244](https://github.com/RodrigoFAbreu/workflow-controller/issues/244), the false ACTION_REQUIRED alerts), then H4b (the headless Codex launch behind the H3 seam); TK1 is implemented.
