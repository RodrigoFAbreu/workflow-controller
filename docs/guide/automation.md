# What the Controller automates, and how it stays safe

[Back to the documentation map](../README.md)

## Safety model

- **Never writes Workflow state.** `controller/target_state.py` exposes
  no write function at all; every durable Workflow lifecycle change is
  made by a worker running a real Workflow command in the target
  repository.
- **Never crosses a human gate.** The decision engine launches only by
  the automatic-dispatch rule, whose declared outcomes cover only
  commands in its eight-command selected set (`/milestone-plan`,
  `/review-plan`, `/record-manual-plan-review`, `/apply-plan-review`,
  `/milestone-implement`, `/review-implementation`,
  `/apply-implementation-review`, `/record-manual-implementation-review`).
  The worker layer refuses to execute any of the four user-only commands
  (`controller.worker.USER_ONLY_COMMANDS`) even if handed one directly,
  including inside a task's text -- two independent mechanisms fed by two
  different sources.
- **Never trusts a worker's word.** Every launched job is verified
  against durable Workflow and Git state, including the artifacts its
  command promises; the worker's own report is never read to decide.
- **One worker per worktree, and never a replacement too early.** The
  lifecycle lock, the recorded worker and the processes it owns decide
  when the previous worker has ended, never elapsed time or the end of a
  turn. A job is reconciled only after its worker has ended and its owned
  work has drained.
- **Never hot-reloads.** A running Controller generation executes from an
  immutable, content-addressed snapshot of its own source and never
  mutates or reloads it; a newer approved generation triggers an
  intentional stop (a durable handoff record, exit 50), never an
  in-process update.
- **Never merges, never rewrites.** No Controller code path merges a pull
  request or pushes to the trunk ref, and the GitHub boundary
  (`controller/forge.py`) has no merge operation. The Controller never
  force-pushes, resets, rebases, amends, deletes a ref or moves a tag:
  every branch push is a fast-forward and every tag push creates a new
  ref. A human merges every pull request.

## Automatic dispatch

Each phase handler selects the next action from the target's evidence, or
returns a human gate. Whether a selected action is launched is decided by
one rule, the same at every phase: it is launched **iff** a verifiable
expected outcome is declared for `(phase, governing workflow version,
command)` (`controller.decision.AUTOMATIC_TRIPLES`, held equal to the
keys of `controller.job.EXPECTED_OUTCOMES` by a test). Otherwise it is
reported as declined (exit 15), with a reason that names the phase, the
command and the missing triple. Unknown or ambiguous states still fail
closed (exit 20).

At the 2.5.1 reference release, that makes these launches automatic:

| Phase | Version | Command |
|---|---|---|
| no work item yet | none | `/milestone-plan` |
| `PLANNING` | `"1"`, `"2.1"`, `"2.2"` | `/milestone-plan` |
| `AWAITING_LOCAL_PLAN_REVIEW` | `"2.1"`, `"2.2"` | `/review-plan` |
| `AWAITING_MANUAL_EXTERNAL_PLAN_REVIEW` | `"2.1"`, `"2.2"` | `/record-manual-plan-review` |
| `REVISING_PLAN` | `"2.1"`, `"2.2"` | `/apply-plan-review` |
| `AWAITING_EXTERNAL_PLAN_REVIEW` | `"1"` | `/apply-plan-review` |
| `IMPLEMENTING`, `SELF_REVIEWING_IMPLEMENTATION` | `"2.1"`, `"2.2"` | `/milestone-implement`, once the plan approval is `CURRENT` and `HEAD` records every checkpoint completion and phase transition the working tree records |
| `AWAITING_LOCAL_IMPLEMENTATION_REVIEW` | `"2.2"` | `/review-implementation` |
| `AWAITING_MANUAL_EXTERNAL_IMPLEMENTATION_REVIEW` | `"2.2"` | `/record-manual-implementation-review`, only for an already-pasted, admissible manual `APPROVE`/`REVISE` |
| `APPLYING_REVIEW_FEEDBACK` | `"2.2"` | `/apply-implementation-review`, for an admissible `REVISE` |

Every one of these is still gated first when its evidence says so: a
`REJECTED` bundle marker, a stale or incoherent bundle, a `BLOCK` verdict,
an inadmissible verdict, a missing or stale plan approval, a checkpoint
`COMPLETE` or a `SELF_REVIEWING_IMPLEMENTATION` transition that the
working tree's `WORKFLOW_STATE.json` records but `HEAD` does not. Everything
else is a gate or a decline. That includes performing the manual external
review, `/approve-review`, `/accept-milestone`, the functional-review
stage (`/apply-functional-review` is declined), `AMENDING_PLAN`, and
consuming a `"2.1"` external implementation verdict. A `"1"` work item's
`/milestone-implement` is declined, because that branch writes no state
the Controller could verify.

A launched job is verified against durable Workflow and Git state, never
against what the worker says. A phase change alone is not success: each
implementation-stage outcome also checks the artifacts it promises (the
checkpoint completion committed at `HEAD`, a coherent implementation
bundle generated at the live `HEAD`, a review ledger bound to the
bundle's content). A stale, withdrawn, `REJECTED` or mis-bound artifact
makes the job `FAILED` (exit 30), and `run` stops there. The next decision
launches nothing either. After an uncommitted checkpoint completion or
`SELF_REVIEWING_IMPLEMENTATION` transition, for example, it is a gate
naming each uncommitted fact, because another `/milestone-implement`
worker could build on the completion or commit it. A human commits the
completion as the Workflow step would have, with its trailers, or
discards it and reruns the step.

## Implementation-review apply rounds

`/apply-implementation-review` at a `"2.2"` `APPLYING_REVIEW_FEEDBACK`
has three safeguards:

- **The pending-write addendum.** After an automated local `REVISE`, or
  an ingested manual `REVISE`, the review-stage write that moved the work
  item to `APPLYING_REVIEW_FEEDBACK` is normally still uncommitted. A
  worker that followed the command text literally would then land a
  malformed generation-record commit. So, only while `HEAD` does not yet
  record `APPLYING_REVIEW_FEEDBACK`, the worker's task is the command
  followed by a pinned Controller note. The note authorizes exactly one
  extra act: commit that pending state write alone, with a
  `Workflow-Work-Item` trailer, before any other commit. It names no
  user-only command. `explain` prints it, and the job record keeps it as
  `selected_action.task_addendum`. This is the only place a worker's task
  is not the bare selected command.
- **The malformed-`T` gate.** If a worker lands the generation-record
  commit `T` anyway, with no phase change in its own diff (`OPUS-R101-001`),
  the next decision names that commit and says that no Workflow command
  repairs it. A human repairs the unpushed history so the pending write
  lands alone before `T`, then reruns the command's step 7. The
  Controller does not offer the ordinary regeneration steps there,
  because the generator would refuse them.
- **The relaunch bound.** An `/apply-implementation-review` attempt that
  did not verify is never relaunched automatically against the bundle it
  started from. Once such an attempt passed its own step 4, the bundle no
  longer matches its manifest, so every retry would refuse at step 1. The
  gate names the earlier job and the human's two ways on: restore the
  edited bundle file from `review-bundle.tar.gz` and rerun the command in
  a supervised session, or complete the round by hand. A new bundle
  generation lifts the bound.
