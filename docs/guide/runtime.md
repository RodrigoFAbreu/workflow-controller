# Runtime state and runtime identity

[Back to the documentation map](../README.md)

## Controller-owned runtime state

The Controller keeps its own durable state under a runtime root: pinned
source identity, job records (`jobs/`, with abandoned originals under
`jobs/abandoned/`), per-job logs (`jobs/<job_id>/`), run records
(`runs/`), milestone binding records (`repositories/`, below) and the
pending handoff. The root is resolved by a ladder, and
the first row that applies wins:

1. `--runtime-dir`;
2. `WORKFLOW_CONTROLLER_HOME`;
3. `<origin checkout>/.controller/`, only for a **source** runtime;
4. `$XDG_STATE_HOME/workflow-controller`, or
   `~/.local/state/workflow-controller` when `XDG_STATE_HOME` is unset.

A package runtime (a pipx or other wheel install) never uses row 3, even
when its venv sits inside a Git checkout, so without the first two rows
it uses row 4. Before 1.1 a wheel installed into a venv inside a
checkout resolved to `<site-packages>/.controller`. Every acting command
from such an install failed, so that directory holds no job history, and
it can be deleted. `status` prints the resolved root and its ladder row.

This tree is disposable by design. It is never part of any managed
target repository's own state, and the Controller never writes into a
target repository's `WORKFLOW_STATE.json` -- only a worker running a
real Workflow command does that. The lifecycle lock is an `flock` on the
target's existing git directory and creates nothing there. Deleting
`runs/` or `jobs/<job_id>/` loses presentation history only: no
lifecycle decision reads them.

`repositories/<repo_key>/milestones/` holds one binding record per
milestone of a policy-enabled target (`<work_item_id>.json`), its
append-only `<work_item_id>/events.jsonl`, and any
`<work_item_id>.abandoned-<n>.json` left by a re-planned id. `repo_key`
is the SHA-256 of the target's canonical `git rev-parse --git-common-dir`,
so every worktree of one repository shares it. Unlike `runs/`, these
records **are** read by lifecycle decisions: they are the Controller's
only memory of which branch and pull request belong to a milestone. Do
not delete them while a milestone is in flight, and include them in any
backup of the runtime root. If they are lost anyway (a new machine, for
example), the next step with `HEAD` on the milestone branch re-adopts the
binding and its one open pull request. A branch that exists only on the
remote, or two merged pull requests for one branch, refuses: the
Controller cannot tell which is its own, and the recovery is to restore
`repositories/<repo_key>/` from the backup. A 1.1.1 runtime ignores the
directory.

## Runtime identity

Every Controller process knows what code it is running, and records it.
There are three runtime kinds:

- **`package`**: an installed wheel. The wheel carries
  `controller/BUILD_INFO.json`, written by the build (`setup.py`'s
  `build_py` hook), which records the version, the source commit, whether
  the build's inputs had uncommitted changes, a digest of the package's
  files, the build origin (`release` or `local`) and the release tag.
  A package runtime never runs Git and never consults the checkout it was
  built from. `step`, `run` and `resume` copy the installed package into
  a snapshot and check the copy against the recorded package digest; an
  installation edited after it was built is refused (exit `20`). A wheel
  built from uncommitted changes, or with no verifiable provenance (for
  example from an sdist), needs `--allow-dirty-source`, like a dirty
  checkout.
- **`source`**: a Git checkout whose top level holds the running
  `controller/` package, tracked. This is what `pip install -e .` gives
  you.
- **`unidentified`**: anything else, for example a wheel built without the
  hook, or a checkout that contains a stray `controller/BUILD_INFO.json`
  (delete it to run from source). Read-only commands still work and print
  the reason. `step`, `run` and `resume` refuse with exit `20`.

The Controller never reads installer metadata such as `direct_url.json`.

`workflow-controller --version` prints two lines and writes nothing:

```
workflow-controller 1.2.1
runtime: package (release v1.2.1; built from 0123456789ab; package 3f2a1c9d0b7e)
```

Line 1 is always `workflow-controller <version>`. Line 2 is one of
`package (release ...)`, `package (local build from <commit>)` with
`, uncommitted changes` when that applies, `package (local build, unknown
provenance)`, `source (<checkout> @ <commit>)` with the same suffix, or
`unidentified (<reason>)`. `status` opens with the same text:
`controller: workflow-controller 1.2.1 -- package (...)`.

Every job record carries a `controller_runtime` block (`runtime_kind`,
`version`, `source_kind`, `source_commit`, `tree_digest`,
`package_digest`, `build_origin`, `release_tag`, `generation`), and so do
`identity.json` and `SOURCE_PIN.json`. `inspect --json` and
`explain --json` carry it as `controller`. The older
`controller_generation`/`controller_source_commit`/`controller_source_tree_digest`
fields stay.

What `build_origin: "release"` proves is limited. The build sets it from
an environment variable, so any local build can claim it. The proof that
a wheel is a release is its checksum in the GitHub Release's
`SHA256SUMS`, not `--version`. Build-provenance attestation may come
later.

The version (`pyproject.toml`'s static `[project].version`, `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`) and the
generation (`controller/GENERATION.json`) are separate. The generation is
the compatibility axis that handoff and job-record validation compare.
Version 1.2.1 is still generation 1.
